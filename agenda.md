### 8:30- 10:30 Pitches by participants

[5 minute lightning talks](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/future-of-software-design-workshop-2017/blob/master/participation.md#lighting-talks) by participants, their input/what they bring to the table. At a minimum we should probably ask:
What are the challenges that current technology/advances are not addressing
What kind of a vision will drive software systems of the future that the individual sees
What are the needed innovations that we should be rallying behind

This time slot assumes about 10 presentations. This can be done pre-prepared or we can do it open space style as well. 

### 10:30-11:00 Break

### 11:00-12:00 pitches continue

The point of the pitches is that we take a note of the themes, probe for discussion, group ideas etc as well. This should continue as a group too.

### 12:00-13:00 Lunch

### 13:00-15:00 Small group discussion

We can use several techniques here. If there a actual themes emerging we can just divide up. But I find that rarely useful. I am not sure how everyone would be receptive but can we maybe try out things like brainwriting for part of the time or even in small groups;

### 15:00-15:30 Break

### 15:30 - 17:30 Group discussion

What are we learning:
	Challenges
	Fruitful directions
	Out of the box ideas

Adjourn for team dinner

## Sunday, Jan 14

On site breakfast

### 8:30 -8:45 Sync up

Give everyone a chance to reflect on the activities, are we converging/diverging

### 8:45-10:00 How would we explain what we talked about to others?

I don’t have a good way of titling this, but if people are excited what would be the mechanism to share, what is the call to action. Obviously we will not solve anything in a day and a half, but we can come up with a starting action plan?

### 10:30-11:00 Break

### 11:00-12:00 Discussion, next steps, retrospective

### 12:00 Lunch and adjourn
